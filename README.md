# Objectives
The app can provide some information about the climate and allow a lot of flexibility for the users to navigate between datasets, plots, and analyses. In the 'Findings' tab, I presented with some of my findings by illustrating with the plots. I made comparisons with different datasets with the variable, year, and make a reasonable prediction of what the climate will be in the future.

# Findings
1. From this plot, I find that in all four seasons, the average temperature is gradually increasing year after year. Each set of data is a representative to one season, and each trend line is upward sloping. Therefore, our climate is becoming warmer and warmer.

2. In this plot below, Co2 is increasing dramatically over time with an estimated slope of 1.772 which means that the average Co2 increases 1.772 ppm every year. This might be one of the primary reason that causes global warming. From the plot, we can see that Co2 is fluctuating in in a regular pattern. It seems like in some certain months, the Co2 decreases and increases in some other months. However, the overall pattern is increasing.

3. From the plots below, it seems like the temperature has positive linear relationships with rainfall, snowfall, and Co2. Therefore, we can expect that the climate will become hotter, more snow, more rain, and more Co2 in the air in the future.
